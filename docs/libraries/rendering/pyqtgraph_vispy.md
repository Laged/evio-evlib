# PyQtGraph / VisPy

**What:** GPU-accelerated plotting/imaging toolkits built on Qt + OpenGL. Good for fast image updates, point clouds, and multi-view layouts.

**Pros**
- High redraw performance on images/heatmaps/point clouds.
- Built-in layouts/docking via Qt; easy to compose multiple views (raw, overlay, heatmap, plots).
- Compatible with our Qt stack already present via OpenCV.

**Cons**
- Adds Qt widget dependency to the UI; packaging is heavier than cv2.
- Not as turnkey for game-like effects; custom GL still possible but less direct than ModernGL.

**Fit for our architecture**
- Keep evlib ingestion headless; feed frames/arrays to PyQtGraph/VisPy for display.
- Ideal for a dashboard app (multi-pane: raw, overlay, RVT tensor heatmap, plots).
- Gate as optional extra to avoid imposing Qt on minimal users.

**Typical use**
- Create a main window with multiple `ImageItem` / `ViewBox` entries.
- Update textures each frame from NumPy buffers generated by detectors/evlib.
- Add checkboxes/hotkeys via Qt to toggle overlays.
