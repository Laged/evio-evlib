# 01 – Problem Statement

- Sensofusion excels at RF/acoustic drone detection, but silent/optical-fiber drones evade those modalities.
- 360° rotating coverage with frame cameras misses fast movers; latency and motion blur are blockers.
- Event cameras offer microsecond latency and high dynamic range for fast drone tracking.
- Challenge path: start with fan RPM → varying RPM → idle/moving drones, then scale to tracking and labeling.
